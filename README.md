# Recipe Finder
Ever had some things in your fridge that you didn't know what to do with? Maybe you're not sure how to put them together and make it taste good at the same time. Well, I made a simple app to help you with those tough decisions and make dinner planning easier.

This is a recipe finder app that allows you to search for recipes based on the ingredients that you enter in the text box.

Just enter the ingredients that you have in the text box as shown below, then click on "Get Recipe!"

The app will then take the data you entered and show results of recipes based on what you entered. It will show a list of possible dishes that you can make with what you have.

That's not all! The items on the list are clickable links that result in Google searches of the recipe name that you clicked on so you can get the recipe of that dish.
